# WA01-Fix-Me
Due Wednesday, Feb 22 at 5pm.

## Find and fix the errors

Clone this repo (don't fork) and run the code in `BasicMenu.py` in IDLE. Find all of the errors, fix them, then push your changes to the your repo. That's it!

## How to turn in.

The work flow is just like the lab but you have write access. That means you don't have to fork. Just clone it, make edits, add files, then push. No pull request is required. This repo is your own repo and only you and I can see it.

Feel free to email or leave comments if you have questions. Enjoy!
